# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Antonio Giacchetti 

## :computer: CS Student  |  :camera: Visual Artist  |  :space_invader: Gaming Enthusiast

### About Me

:rocket: I'm a current CS student with a background in visual art. I have a passion for writing, design, and technology; and I hope to pursue opportunties where I can blend my creative experiences to come up with innovative solutions to the problems of today, tomorrow, and beyond.

:floppy_disk: Way back in the 90's my father (a network engineer and early adopter of the Internet) ensured I always had access to the latest and greatest in tech. He encouraged me to explore and implement technology into my life and I continue to carry that enthusiasm with me to this day.

### Experience

ðŸŽ“ I graduated from [OCAD University](https://www.ocadu.ca/) in 2017, having secured a Bachelor of Fine Art (Photography) & an English Minor. Between 2015 and 2017 I participated in over a dozen exhibitions and have shown work in various locations in Canada, Germany, and Finland. After graduating, I operated as a freelance designer, and personal assistant to [Barbara Astman](https://www.corkingallery.com/artists/49-barbara-astman/) for several years. 

:key: In early 2019, I found myself leading a sizeable online community of social gamers. Through the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, this community grew and acted as a social hub for those folks to hang-out, laugh, and unwind over those rough years. Although establishing this community was largely a personal endeavor, I believe the experience granted me a powerful set of organizational and leadership tools that I continue to apply in my daily life. This community remains a staple in my life and I'm proud to have had a part in its growth and management.

ðŸ”¬ In more recent years, I've explored a general but deep interest in technology and am currently pursuing a technical diploma in Networking at [Mohawk College](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/). Although my CS experience is admittedly limited, I am eager to practice and improve on the skills I'm rapidly developing. I believe I bring a fresh perspective to the field and am already applying my studies to augment and optimize my workflow.

### Skills

:cd: My skills and interests are rapidly evolving and include but are certainly not limited to:

Virtualization, HTML, CSS, Python, Network Design, Unix Systems, and Server Administration
