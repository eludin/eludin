# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Antonio Giacchetti 

## :computer: CSIT Student  |  :camera: Visual Artist  |  :space_invader: Gaming Enthusiast

### About Me

:rocket: I'm a CSIT student with a background in visual art. I'm passionate about writing, design, and technology; and I hope to pursue opportunties where I can blend my creative experiences to come up with innovative solutions for the problems of today, and tomorrow.

### Experience

ðŸŽ“ I graduated from [OCAD University](https://www.ocadu.ca/) in 2017, with a BFA in Photography & an English Minor. I've participated in over a dozen exhibitions throughout Canada, Germany, and Finland. 
After graduating, I operated as a freelance designer, and personal assistant to [Barbara Astman](https://www.corkingallery.com/artists/49-barbara-astman/) for several years. 

:key: In early 2019, I founded a social community for gamers called "Maledict". At its peak, this community became a social hub for over 40 adults to hang-out, laugh, and unwind at the end of the day. 
This community became a lifeline for many of its members during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'm proud to have had a part in its leadership, organization, and management. 

ðŸ”¬ I am currently pursuing a technical diploma in Networking at [Mohawk College](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/); and I'm eager to practice and improve on the skills I'm rapidly developing. 
I believe I bring a fresh perspective to the field and am already applying my studies to augment and optimize my workflow.

### Current Fields of Study:

:cd: UNIX Systems, Server Administration, Network Design and Management, Virtualization, BASH, Python, HTML, and CSS
